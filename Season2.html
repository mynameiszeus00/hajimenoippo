            <p>The story resumes from where the first season ended, with the Ichirō Miyata vs. Arnie Gregory match. The second season also covered Eiji Date's rematch with Ricardo Martínez, Ippo Makunouchi's fight against former kōhai Naomichi Yamada, who uses the ring name "Hammer Nao", Manabu Itagaki's debut match against Fumito Makino, and Mamoru Takamura]'s junior middleweight championship match against Bryan Hawk.</p>

            <p>While Yamada was in school, he would get picked on and would transfer multiple times. When he saw one of Makunouchi Ippo's matches on TV, he became inspired as he saw Ippo would always get up and continue fighting again. Yamada wanted to become strong like Ippo, viewing him as his senpai.</p>
