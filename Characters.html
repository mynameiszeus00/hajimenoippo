            <h2>Greet From A World Champ!</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Nice to meet you! I am <b>Mamoru Takamura</b>, "Well, well, look what the cat dragged in!" I bellow, my voice booming with mock enthusiasm. "Did you come to box or just to admire my godlike physique? Don’t worry, I get it—it’s hard to focus when greatness like me is around." I flex dramatically, striking a pose that’s equal parts ridiculous and impressive. Then, with a wink, I add, "But if you’re here to train, I hope you packed a lunch because this gym doesn’t babysit weaklings. Oh, and if you’re here to fight me, good luck—I’ll even autograph the hospital bill for you!" I burst into laughter, patting my chest as if my own joke was too much to handle.

                <h3>Genji Kamogawa (Owner/Trainer/Coach)</h3>
                <p><b>Genji Kamogawa</b>, commonly referred to as <b>Mr. Kamogawa</b>, He is a long old retired prizefighter who founded the Kamogawa gym years later after retiring. He acts as the main trainer of both students of his, Mamoru Takamura and Ippo Makunouchi, as well as a second for the boxers under Shinoda.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Kamogawa worked as a prizefighter in Japan shortly after the end of World War II. He has had multiple boxing matches with former prizefighter Ginpachi Nekota, two of which he lost, two of which he won, and another that ended a draw. He was also friends with fellow prizefighter and future trainer Dankichi Hama. During the American occupation of Japan, Kamogawa harboured strong feelings of national pride, refusing to accept food handouts.

                <h3>Haruhiko Yagi (General Manager)</h3>
                <p><b>Haruhiko Yagi</b>, His duties as a gym manager primarily consist of publicity and match booking, but he also takes part in managing the finances, selling merchandise, and occasionally assists with the training.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Yagi and Kamogawa Genji, while watching a world match on the TV, talked about how they haven't raised a world champion since the Kamogawa Boxing Gym opened. Yagi informed Kamogawa that Takamura Mamoru brought a newcomer. When Kamogawa assigned Makunouchi Ippo to spar against Miyata Ichirō, Yagi watched the spar, concluding that despite Ippo's loss, he has great determination. After Ippo won the second spar against Miyata, Yagi and Kamogawa were shown how Miyata barely got hit with the uppercut by 1cm.</p>

                <p> When Tatsuya Kimura and Masaru Aoki joined the Kamogawa gym, Shinoda looked over their training.[3] After eight months, Shinoda told the duo that their pro debut was scheduled. Shinoda then was their second for their pro debut, with both of them winning in the end.</p>
