                <h3>Hajime No Ippo: Boxer's Fist (SPECIAL)</h3>
                <h4>Year Released: 2000 (Time:30mins)<h4>
                <p>"Boxer's Fist" is not based on any round/chapter from the manga, so it is a DVD-original. It's there to shows Takamura's backstory (at least partially, his start of being part of Kamogawa Boxing Gym) and explains why the Kamogawa boxing gym walls are yellow in the anime.</p>

                <h3>Hajime No Ippo Fighting Spirit: Champion Road (MOVIE)</h3>
                <h4>Year Released: 2003 (Time: 1h 30m)<h4>
                <p>In this movie you see Ippo in his first title defense after he defeats Sendo at the end of the series. It shows Ippo and how well he has developed over months after the fierce fight with Sendo. He learns that his opponent is the former junior featherweight champion who is very strong and his name is Sanada Kazuki and since he is a doctor he knows where to hit a person to inflict max damage without having to have a lot of power. There is another twist to this great film. Sanada corner man is Ippo's trainer Kamogawa old opponent. This movie is a must see for all Hajime no Ippo fans. Lots of bone crushing blows and of course humor, an enjoyable film for all fans. I recommend this film for all anime fans and non-anime fans everywhere.</p>

                <h3>Hajime No Ippo Fighting Spirit: Mashiba VS Kimura (MOVIE)</h3>
                <h4>Year Released: 2003 (Time: 1h 1m)<h4>
                <p>The annual Champion Carnival begins. The first match that goes into the spotlight is the Japanese junior lightweight title match between Kimura Tatsuya and Mashiba Ryō. Due to the first and second ranker backing out of the Champion Carnival to avoid Mashiba, Kimura, the third ranker chose to fight Mashiba. Kimura turned to Miyata Ichirō for help against Mashiba and began training for a new technique.</p>
